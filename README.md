# Android WordPress REST API example
An easy user case for using WordPress REST API in the Android Platform (developed in JAVA)

The aim is to display all posts of my blog on the Android app, then to displaya Single Post template like (a child activity).

In this example, I used some great libraries and Android API :
  * Retrofit : A JAVA library to make REST API calls easily
  * Picasso : An Android library to set an ImageView with an URL
  * Material Design support for Cards
  * Collapsing toolbar to have a nice parallax effect with the post thumbnail
